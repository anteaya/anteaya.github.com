    <p>Tuesday November 27, 2012</p>

    <p>I learned about the GNOME Outreach Program for Women while on Twitter. I saw a <a href="http://twitter.com/railsbridge/status/269142103299354624">tweet</a> from the RailsBridge account linking to the GNOME OPW <a href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen">homepage</a>.</p>
    
    <p>There is a lot of information on the page and I found it a bit overwhelming. I located the information for the IRC channel (#opw on the irc.gnome.org server - GIMP server on my X-chat) and joined the channel. I soon found myself in conversation with one of the program administrators, marina, and she welcomed me and helped me navigate the qualifying information. I self identify as a woman and it doesn't matter where in the world I reside, all work is done remotely.</p>
    
    <p>I soon met others in the channel, and started to narrow down what I was looking for and what was available. Sumana from Wikimedia spoke up as did reed from OpenStack. We had a good conversation and I was very happy to meet so many people who were welcoming and supportive of my concerns and questions. I followed a lot of links and read a lot of web pages that day.</p>
    
    <p>I let my experience filter through me during the night and the next day I joined the #opw channel again. This time I met a different person from OpenStack, iccha, and we started talking. I have forgotten the exact flow, a week seems so long ago, but we exchanged emails and I was given some links to help me understand what OpenStack was all about.</p>
    
    <p>Iccha encouraged me to meet other OpenStackers, which I did both on IRC and Google Hangout and I started realizing that I was really enjoying the OpenStack energy.</p>
    
    <p>It is funny because there are so many great projects available through GNOME Outreach Program for Women but what made up my mind was the people. Every time I had a question, someone was there to either answer me or help me find an answer and over the course of several days I realized that it was OpenStack people who were most consistent and available.</p>
    
    <p>I'm a quick learner and tend to be rather flexible in the work that I do so I am most drawn to a work environment than a certain flavour of task. I was impressed by the environment of OpenStack as conveyed by the people. Thank you OpenStack, you helped me select what environment I most prefer.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you as well to everyone involved with GNOME Outreach Program for Women, it is a solid project that I am really happy to know about. Thank you for creating the structure that makes this kind of discovery and interaction possible.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks for reading,<br />Anita Kuno.</p>

				<p>Friend asks me to help him access a sqlite file since his MobileMe upgrade wiped out parts of his address book and he retrieved this file.</p>
				<p>He emailed me the file and created a directory 'sqlite' and moved the file inside. I was in a terminal and moved into the 'sqlite' directory. Then I input <em>sqlite3 filename.sqlitedb</em> into the command line which dropped me into sqlite. At the sqlite prompt I input <em>.databases</em> expecting it to show me the database information but instead I got a 'file encrypted or corrupted error'.</p>
<p> I exited from sqlite and input <em>strings filename.sqlitedb</em> in bash and recieved output some of which I could read. So that meant that the file was not encrypted, the file just was not an sqlite file (even though it had the .sqlitedb file extension). So I input <em>strings filename.sqlitedb > file.txt</em> and sent my friend the file.txt in an email.</p>
				<p>He was very happy since this output was more accessible to him than the .sqlitedb file.</p>
				<p>The End</p>

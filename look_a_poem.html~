I find my way by the light of your heart
heart candle
candy of your soul
heaven bless them
the water from my fingers
running across my palms
crying from my shoulders
running off the spirits in my hair
the weight of the world is down
take care of it yourself
the sun shines to my heart
I can carry your misery no longer
if you don't understand
the montsters you create
it isn't my job to defeat them
turn around
look for yourself
it is you
to create and to face
stand up
confront your frankenstein
the manifestation of your fears
love it when you can
the product of your dispensation

the sun talks to me
through the rain
past the cloud
your fears are yours
do with them as you will

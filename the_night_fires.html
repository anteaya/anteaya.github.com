                        <p>The orange light flickered from across the valley. Three fires. She shifted her hips and waited.</p>
                        <p>The darkness enclosed her and the forest in which she sat. Cloud cover obscured any stars. That would help.</p>
                        <p>She listened and waited. The deadfall on the forest floor absorbed the rain that had fallen the threatened to chill her exposed skin. She stood and shook out her robes, covering and warming her.</p>
                        <p>Her instructions had been specific and she memorized the description. Her employeer's voice echoed in her ear as she reviewed the characteristics of her quarry.</p>
                        <p>Green, metallic, the length of her small finger. She was supposed to look for it attached to a cloak. The instructor hadn't been sure. That made the getting of it tougher. She had pointed this out and waited. Her pay was increased. The same pay she was burying while she waited.</p>
                        <p>Her disguise wouldn't be beliveable if she carried money with her. She had to be beliveable, so the money stayed here.</p>
                        <p>The same rain that had threatened to chill her bones had softened the earth, making the inital trench rather easy.</p>
                        <p>She continued deepening the trench with a flat rock from a nearby stream. The earth continued to move aside for her as she watched the orange flicker and waited.</p>

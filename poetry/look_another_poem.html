<p>I walk on your chest<br />
my feet touch and taste<br />
relish the solidity<br />
cherish the stability<br />
moves with me<br />
inside and out<br />
touch me and let me touch you</p>

<p>my self expands<br />
joined through the flesh<br />
energy rushes from here to there<br />
I feel the journey<br />
larger than my body<br />
I am part<br />
of something<br />
larger than myself</p>

<p>the floor breathes<br />
the wood grows<br />
the physical works to catch up<br />
where the being has gone before</p>

<p>new leaves open<br />
breathing and feeding<br />
the new bones of its being<br />
taking that one more step</p>

  <p>Darkness and light envelop my breath as I move forward, uncertain and hopeful. My feet, lost in darkness; my heart moves toward the glimmer.</p>
  <p>Confronting face of earth and rock. Fingers embedded in rootlets and moss. Tarsal arch lifts and cuts purchase. Shifting my weight, I ascend</p>
  <p>Home again. My dog greets me. Squinty eyes, she smells of sleep. Shakes with collar tags jingling. Puts her nose to the door and turns to me</p>
  <p>Sunshine creeping across my wall. Spreading out, increasing its claim. Sharp shadows from my furniture impede its dominance. Good morning.</p>
  <p>Crystal spires mark six points stamped from vapour high above. Stasis u-nique.. my-nique, his-nique, her-nique, their-nique. Flakes ya'snow.</p>
  <p>Water's slate gray resides in the sky, the air hangs heavy. Water & expectation. Lone flakes swirl partner-less descend and drop. Transition</p>
  <p>Virgin snow. I am first. Tyres impress the plough's winrow. Park; furry excitement bursts. Dog's paws mark our path & I follow branches low</p>
  <p>Wind tells testament of her travel. Bare treetops, maple branches dance, enact her passion; weighed branches freed. A wall of snow descends.</p>
  <p>Stars sparkle dance touch. Glide surface and shimmy. Smile, they beckon. Join and shine. Freely move and sing. I am enticed. My smile flies.</p>
  <p>Intently working; focused. My lap, it beckons. My cat valiantly responding to the call, leaps and settles. Cosy draped across my busy wrists</p>
  <p>my eyes open, draw breath extend my palms, inflate fan embers of my heart fill myself with gladness gratitude joy more and more full</p>
  <p>Green skin rolls back beneath my blade reveling white flesh. A scent of melons; cucumber crunch. My feet in grass, mosquito song in my ears.</p>
  <p>leaping and landing. mmmmm. persistent paws navigate my geography. wend up to my shoulder. doppler purring. gentle breath in my ear, cat'sup</p>
  <p>My cat, my sentinel, perches in the gap of the open window. The seal on the house broken; intact since autumn. The first breath of spring.</p>
  <p>Sweet found snow, blue overhead, buds shorn slender maple branches bead sweet drops touched by sun. Hungry deer bring me taste of spring.</p>
  <p>I remember your touch though you are absent. Activity fills the void, I know you are there. Grace me with your presence; with your smile.</p>
  <p>Fresh snow covers hard crust bones, bare skin. Pine boughs mar the smooth; tufts of whiskers. Stretch over curve and rise; gentle sun. Smile</p>
  <p>My head pound with thoughts and tasks. Snow falls heavy large flakes dance beyond the glass. Bits of sky give a fresh kiss of love and bless</p>
  <p>Sunlight smiles. Trees hold their bark tight. Soon they will act as conduit for the riches beneath the earth. Sugar to feed the beauty. Soon</p>
  <p>My open closet summons my cat. Lurking beyond the bi-fold, hoping that shirt selection distracts. Waiting to leap and nestle amongst socks.</p>
  <p>Twin forces meet. One from above, one from below. Revel and navigate. Celebrate and propagate. Symphony of touch moves and caresses. Ahhhhh.</p>
  <p>Can you see the moon? A sliver of promise glows in the dark void above my house, teasing the treetops and smiling as it descends over there.</p>
  <p>waiting, last p before bed. Robe and clogs, out the door, freeze. tracking moonlight my dog descends the deck, sniffs her spot on the crust.</p>
  <p>gray wind follows night rain warming snow reveals forgotten artifacts from before limp, mussed and intact forestalled decisions must be made</p>
  <p>A decade between sarvangasanas the rust falls away. Thankful for cell memory Modified savasana follows for most of me cat bed for my abdomen</p>
  <p>Tiny flicker taps triplets. I triangulate. Pried bark flakes fall. Testing, tapping. Takes wing. Alights. Drill. Impressive. Adieu. Freezing</p>
  <p>Sun claims Frost's territory. Birds. Warmth. The measured drop into waiting buckets rings out. Carried by the breeze. The Herald of Spring.</p>
  <p>Spurs of frost surface the deck. My furry family, their morning ablutions complete, poise themselves in my window. Their backs warmed by sun</p>
  <p>Etched on my car hood, rachis & barbs gesture outward and dance flowing Safe from the sun they live in the fragility of dawn I am transfixed</p>
  <p>There. Yes, I saw it. Amongst the trees. Slender legs step gracefully, cautiously. Doe careful walking here, there. Turns. Beautiful pose.</p>
  <p>Feeling fragile, delicate. The time between fresh ideas. The elder enacted, the new not yet arrived. Pensive. Void time. Good habits comfort</p>
  <p>Rain today. Branches exposed to wind accumulate drops. Sport buds at each terminus. Rain falls. Wind blows. Preparation for the next stage.</p>
  <p>An army of flakes cut through my view. Accumulation on the garage shingles. My newly naked garden exposed. Safe behind glass, I ache for my.</p>
  <p>Freshly exposed trail a thin veneer of autumn leaves. Ruffled where deer hooves punch down in the soft mud. Splay hoof marks from a bounding</p>
  <p>Copper moon, dream beacon. Expanding in Libra. Drawing my liquid life toward you. Ole ways surface for the washing of tears. Clearing space.</p>
  <p>Moonshine on frozen waves forms a water cobble road. Pathway to possibility leads straight to my feet. Golden light of acceptance greets me.</p>
  <p>Morning sun smiles. Crisp morning air cuts thru Last year's detritus a thin layer covers soft spring soil Through the brown, the green peeps</p>
  <p>Bouncing off every released wavelet, the sun's smiles are thousands. Shimmering light caresses the lake's liquid surface. Reunited. Excited.</p>
  <p>the nuthatch lights in the cedar the bough bungeeing up and down. by the garden, a doe, immobile. she regards the house, poised. sun dapples</p>
  <p>Summer sun teases as warm winds forgotten briefly gather themselves leaving a memory of last year touch here & there packing to go miss you.</p>
  <p>sweet strains refrain close my eyes. summer night & stars top down bare feet tickle the side mirror, dotted yellow leads the way in the dark</p>
  <p>I breathe your breath and my day falls behind me. Concerns fall from my shoulders, my heart beats with yours. Shhh. I don't want to explain.</p>
  <p>Breathe my heart, stay close, shhhhhh. There will be time to move but not yet. Darkness holds quiet; promise embrace. The low murmur of you.</p>
  <p>The lake again is mine. Strong branches sans leaves, illustrate gestures against a backdrop of mirrored moonlight filling the garden of lake</p>
  <p>Sunshine glosses fluffy clouds, bare sticks throw their arms into the dance. A dry leaf skates across the deck partnered by the wind. Autumn</p>
  <p>First rays of sunlight shine through frost covered boughs reaching out to caress facets of snowflakes patiently sparkling in their blanket.</p>
  <p>Squeaky snow beneath my boots crisp snow pressed down marking many previous footsteps. The history of my travels in frozen vapour. Sunshine.</p>

<p>the first signs of the new canopy<br />
gently green<br />
signaling the abundance of food<br />
for birds<br />
blackflies<br />
the next stage of green</p>

<p>the swarm descends fulfilling its purpose<br />
instilling gratitude for the cold winter<br />
notable for its absence of blackflies</p>

<p>small puddles<br />
accumulations of water<br />
sprouting herbs<br />
chives and lovage<br />
already flavouring my kitchen soup</p>

<p>spring twists in the treetops<br />
like stretched taffy<br />
snagged here and there<br />
on the once bare brushes of maple trees<br />
tufts of green<br />
stick to the ends of supple twigs<br />
caught and growing</p>

<p>another rainy day</p>

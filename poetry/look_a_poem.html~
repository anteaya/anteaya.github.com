    <p>I find my way by the light of your heart<br />
    heart candle<br />
    candy of your soul<br />
    heaven bless them<br />
    the water from my fingers<br />
    running across my palms<br />
    crying from my shoulders<br />
    running off the spirits in my hair<br />
    the weight of the world is down<br />
    take care of it yourself<br />
    the sun shines to my heart<br />
    I can carry your misery no longer<br />
    if you don't understand<br />
    the monsters you create<br />
    it isn't my job to defeat them<br />
    turn around<br />
    look for yourself<br />
    it is you<br />
    to create and to face<br />
    stand up<br />
    confront your frankenstein<br />
    the manifestation of your fears<br />
    love it when you can<br />
    the product of your dispensation</p>

    <p>the sun talks to me<br />
    through the rain<br />
    past the cloud<br />
    your fears are yours<br />
    do with them as you will</p>

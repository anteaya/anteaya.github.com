<p>I find my way by the light of your heart<br />
heart candle<br />
candy of your soul<br />
heaven bless them<br />
the water from my fingers<br />
running across my palms<br />
crying from my shoulders<br />
running off the spirits in my hair<br />
the weight of the world is down<br />
take care of it yourself<br />
the sun shines to my heart<br />
I can carry your misery no longer<br />
if you don't understand<br />
the monsters you create<br />
it isn't my job to defeat them<br />
turn around<br />
look for yourself<br />
it is you<br />
to create and to face<br />
stand up<br />
confront your frankenstein<br />
the manifestation of your fears<br />
love it when you can<br />
the product of your dispensation</p>

<p>the sun talks to me<br />
through the rain<br />
past the cloud<br />
your fears are yours<br />
do with them as you will</p>

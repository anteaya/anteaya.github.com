<p>I walk on your chest<br />
my feet touch and taste<br />
relish the solidity<br />
cherish the stability<br />
moves with me<br />
inside and out<br />
touch me and let me touch you</p>

<p>my self expands<br />
joined through the flesh<br />
energy rushes from here to there<br />
I feel the journey<br />
larger than my body<br />
I am part
of something
larger than myself</p>

<p>the floor breathes
the wood grows
the physical works to catch up
where the being has gone before</p>

<p>new leaves open
breathing and feeding
the new bones of its being
taking that one more step</p>

		<p>I have selected my kata for the week. The prime factors kata. I let my mentor, Craig, know via email on Monday morning. He is busy with a new client so I am laying down some foundation currently solo but with his approval.</p>

		<p>One of my apprenticeship assignments is to write a web server. I almost said build. Searching for 'build a web server' returned many blog posts of the same embedded youtube video of a guy showing people how to download from apache. Thanks anyway, not what I want. Using the keyword 'write' was a little bit more useful in getting some useful results.</p>

		<p>Currently I'm reading up on wikpedia's offering: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_socket">Internet_socket</a> which is a helpful place to begin. I also found a PDF from PragProg that used to be included in the Pickaxe: <a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/app_socket.pdf">app_socket.pdf</a>. Here is a golden oldie from IBM published in 2005 that walks you through sockets: <a href="https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/l-rubysocks/l-rubysocks-a4.pdf">rubysocks.pdf</a>.</p>

    <p>I found a <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_socket_programming.htm">short tutorial</a> on creating a simple client and server in Ruby. I put my code here: <a href="http://github.com/anteaya/sockets">sockets</a>.</p>

		<p>I'm finding it challenging to work today so I thought perhaps a post would help to provide some clarity. If for noone but myself.</p>

		<p>Cheers.</p>

    <p>Today I have been accepted as an apprentice with 8th Light in Chicago. My mentor is Craig. Thanks for taking a chance on me. Like so much else I do, we will be breaking new ground since this is the first time they have accepted an apprentice to work remotely. I'm grateful they are willing to try this and I am confident we will all get something good from the experience.</p>

    <p>Part of my apprenticeship includes blogging so I thought I would establish this space as the place to do it.</p>

    <p>I'm going over the apprenticeship syllabus and everything looks doable. I'm doing a little research to see if I understand everything as outlined.</p>

    <p>That's all I got right now.</p>

    <p>Cheers.</p>

    <p>I did the Roman Numerals kata this morning. My code is <a href="https://github.com/anteaya/katas/tree/master/roman_numerals/ruby">here</a>.

    <p>I spent some time reading The Ruby Way this week and have been thinking about the role of specs and mocks in testing. I encountered a situation this week where I created a method that returned two objects and rspec was unable to create a corresponding object for the test. Since I had to also refactor my code substantially (I had over loaded my methods and gotten mired by the result), I have not yet gotten back to creating an appropriate test for that particular method. Paul Pagel shared a link with the apprentices for a Martin Fowler <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">post</a> that discussed the difference between mocks and stubs. I found the differentiation useful. Sometimes I want to test state and sometimes I want to test behaviour and I am glad to know that it is possible to test either.</p>

    <p>I like doing katas in the morning. Sometimes I have original thoughts and sometimes I just follow the bouncing ball. I would feel that the second approach is unworthy except that Zed Shaw, whom I feel has some great points to share, has created an entire manual for learning Python on the principal of copying. So watching a video and copying the approach can be a learning experience as well. In any case, both kata and blog post are published so there is something to be said for that.</p>

    <p>Happy Friday. If you are one of my friends who get raptured on the weekend, good journey. I guess I'll see the rest of you next week.</p>

    <p>Cheers.</p>

		<p>I did the Prime Factors <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata">kata</a> this week. I posted my <a href="http://www.codersdojo.com/review/d7f069241e33a9f13d0dd7d20f369fd4a48bc1d1">code</a> on codersdojo.org.</p>

		<p>Here it is on <a href="https://github.com/anteaya/katas/tree/master/prime_factors">github</a>. I also improved a test so that it actually tests what the test says it tests. From a suggestion from my friend Walton.</p>

    <h2>Thursday May 5, 2011</h2>

		<p>Continuing to research web server information. I downloaded the <a href="http://mongrel2.org/home">mongrel2</a> source code and am spending a bit of time taking a peek. I don't know much C but I am trying to at least be able to recognize the patterns, so I thought I would take a look around and see if I could see anything that made sense to me. </p>

		<p>Cheers.</p>

		<p>There is a great vid of a Regular Expressions <a href="http://vimeo.com/23243312">talk</a> by Aaron Kalin from Chicago Ruby on Vimeo. He is writing a gem called <a href="https://github.com/martinisoft/graffiti">graffiti</a>.</p>

    <p>He pointed out some good resources during the talk. <a href="http://www.rubyxp.com/">rubyxp.com</a> is a regular expression tester for ruby 1.9. He suggests the oniguruma gem for use with 1.8. (This requires the libonig-dev library if you don't already have it, I didn't.)</p>
		
		<p>He also suggests a website dedicated to regular expressions, <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">regular-expressions.info</a>.</p>

    <p>Mostly just making notes.</p>
		
		<p>Cheers.</p>

		<p>I have selected my kata for the week. The prime factors kata. I let my mentor, Craig, know via email on Monday morning. He is busy with a new client so I am laying down some foundation currently solo but with his approval.</p>

		<p>One of my apprenticeship assignments is to write a web server. I almost said build. Searching for 'build a web server' returned many blog posts of the same embedded youtube video of a guy showing people how to download from apache. Thanks anyway, not what I want. Using the keyword 'write' was a little bit more useful in getting some useful results.</p>

		<p>Currently I'm reading up on wikpedia's offering: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_socket">Internet_socket</a> which is a helpful place to begin. I also found a PDF from PragProg that used to be included in the Pickaxe: <a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/app_socket.pdf">app_socket.pdf</a>. Here is a golden oldie from IBM published in 2005 that walks you through sockets: <a href="https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/l-rubysocks/l-rubysocks-a4.pdf">rubysocks.pdf</a>.</p>

    <p>I found a <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_socket_programming.htm">short tutorial</a> on creating a simple client and server in Ruby. I put my code here: <a href="http://github.com/anteaya/sockets">sockets</a>.</p>

		<p>I'm finding it challenging to work today so I thought perhaps a post would help to provide some clarity. If for noone but myself.</p>

		<p>Cheers.</p>

    <p>Today I have been accepted as an apprentice with 8th Light in Chicago. My mentor is Craig. Thanks for taking a chance on me. Like so much else I do, we will be breaking new ground since this is the first time they have accepted an apprentice to work remotely. I'm grateful they are willing to try this and I am confident we will all get something good from the experience.</p>

    <p>Part of my apprenticeship includes blogging so I thought I would establish this space as the place to do it.</p>

    <p>I'm going over the apprenticeship syllabus and everything looks doable. I'm doing a little research to see if I understand everything as outlined.</p>

    <p>That's all I got right now.</p>

    <p>Cheers.</p>

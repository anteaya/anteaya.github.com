    <h1>My 8th Light Apprenticeship Blog</h1>

    <div class="sidenote">My best attempt at regular blogging. Y'know like other folks do.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Today I have been accepted as an apprentice with 8th Light in Chicago. My mentor is Craig. Thanks for taking a chance on me. Like so much else I do, we will be breaking new ground since this is the first time they have accepted an apprentice to work remotely. I'm grateful they are willing to try this and I am confident we will all get something good from the experience.</p>

    <p>Part of my apprenticeship includes blogging so I thought I would establish this space as the place to do it.</p>

    <p>I'm going over the apprenticeship syllabus and everything looks doable. I'm doing a little research to see if I understand everything as outlined.</p>

    <p>That's all I got right now.</p>

    <p>Cheers.</p>

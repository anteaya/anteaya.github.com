    <h1>The Medium & The Message</h1>

    <p>I think that computing is about communication.</p>

    <p>The medium of the art is 1's and 0's.</p>

    <p>There are a sea of 1's and 0's the same as there are seas of water and seas of air and seas of ether. Computation takes place in a sea of 1's and 0's.</p>

    <p>In communication there is an originator and a receiver. Sometimes the receiver doesn't share the same time reference as the originator so the medium retains the message for a while.</p>

    <p>The 1's and 0's don't care what message they carry the same as clay or silk or pigment and medium don't care about the message they retain. They hold it because that is their nature. But they influence, they influence the receiver and if the originator has created their message accurately, the receiver understands the message.</p>

    <p>Creating with clay requires an understanding of moisture and temperature. Creating with silk requires an understanding of absorption and tension. Creating with pigment and medium requires an understanding of viscosity and pressure. Creating with 1's and 0's requires an understanding of protocols.</p>

    <p>Clay comes from the earth and has certain properties. The role of aluminium and the role of silicon make clay unique among minerals. It can do what it can do because of what it is.</p>

    <p>Ones and zeros are ideas. They come from abstractions of our need to understand quantity. They are unique because they represent two of the most important concepts of mathematics. The idea of existence and the idea of absence. Taken together they can convey the concept of increase and decrease. From there, many more ideas and concepts are possible. Ones and zeros can do what they can do because of the meaning we impart to them.</p>

    <p>The medium of 1's and 0's are important and powerful because of the meaning that we give to them. In order to participate in the conversation that uses 1's and 0's, one must first understand the meaning that has been imparted to them (and culturally accepted) previously. These ideas of meaning take the form of protocols.</p>

    <p>The earth rotated about its axis regardless of anybody living on it believing that it did. Even though some believed the earth rotated, until Foucault got busy in his basement, nobody could prove that it did. Ergo, the culturally accepted belief was the earth didn't rotate. The rotation of the earth is a universal principle. Regardless of the beliefs and behaviours of the populace, the earth rotates. Whether anybody wants to incorporate that fact into their culture makes not one whit of difference to the earth or its rotation about its axis.</p>

    <p>Computation of numbers depends on the behaviour of the numbers, shapes and ideas involved. Regardless of their geography, different cultures have an understanding of quantity and a language to express it. The choice of the base number varies according to the culture. Base 10 is popular, base 20 existed in Central America, base 2 is used with computers. But the choice of base is merely a dialect in the continued pursuit of accurately expressing concepts including quantity.</p>

    <p>Software and its creation utilizes the medium of 1's and 0's. Often it is used to communicate ideas. The challenge is for the message to be carried by the medium in such a way that the receiver can understand the meaning of the originator.</p>

    <p>In art, shape and colour influence our subconscious and our emotions. Our emotional brain helps to inform our rational brain in the interpretation of the message. Indeed, as Jonah Lehrer illustrates in his book, "<a href="http://www.jonahlehrer.com/books">How We Decide</a>", the rational brain separated from the support of the emotional brain is often unable to accurately interpret and understand incoming information. So how to convey a message using a sea of 1's and 0's that can be understood by emotions as well as logic?</p>

    <p>This is been my major dilemma since I started understanding software. It is only just now that I am able to express my feelings on the topic.</p>

    <p>Theatre is an art form of conventions. Most cultures have acting and presentation displays but what is exciting and comforting to one culture makes no sense to another. The masks and costumes of Asian theatre are based upon cultural archetypes and don't require explanation to theatre-goers familiar with the archetypes. First Nation's celebrations have many small protocols that convey respect of the drummers and other dancers. Attending to the protocols generates acceptance, disrespect of the protocols results in ostracization.</p>

    <p>Software operates in a theatre. The theatre has conventions. The theatre is located in a community. The community has conventions. The community is located in a region. The region has conventions. The region is populated by inhabitants who share a culture. The culture has conventions. In order to stage a performance that is tolerated, accepted and perhaps even lauded by the culture, the creator has to understand the conventions. Another word for conventions is protocols.</p>

    <p>When I think of protocols, I think if C-3PO. What was his role? I mean besides stating the obvious and never wanted to try anything new. He received information and translated it for others. I don't plan on being like Cypher, looking at the Matrix and seeing the qualities of different elements. I'm standing on a bank looking at 1's and 0's trying to figure out how to extract the message and also to create my own. Do I become C-3PO? Or do I employ him? So far, I'm not sure. But writing this out so I can clarify it for myself has helped me organize my thoughts.</p>

    <p>Cheers.</p>

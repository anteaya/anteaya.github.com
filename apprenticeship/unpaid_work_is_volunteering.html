    <p>There seems to be some confusion in certain circles about how to reference work which is unpaid. For the sake of clarity, I post. Unpaid work is called <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/volunteering">volunteering.</a> There are many worthy causes which perform many admirable <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">services</a> due to the hard work of volunteers. Kudos to <a href="http://www.globalgiving.org/projects/japan-earthquake-tsunami-relief/">them</a>, I say. Volunteering is the lifeblood of many communities and vital healthcare and humanitarian aid is available due to those kind souls who volunteer.</p>

    <p>So let us acknowledge those people who believe in their cause enough to foot the bill themselves. Let us call them volunteers.</p>

    <p>If an individual desires an experience enough to pay for their living expenses out of their own pocket, let us acknowledge them with the honourable title of volunteer.</p>

    <p>Let's not muddy the water by calling them something that devalues their own investment in their education. Let's not call them intern, let's not call them apprentice, let's not call them anything short of volunteer if they are paying for their living expenses for themselves.</p>

    <p>There seems to be a lot of confusion about how to refer to those people at the bottom of the food chain in a business environment.</p>

    <p>I can't solve all problems with just one post.</p>

    <p>But someone who works for no pay is a volunteer.</p>

<p>I think by now you are understanding that I don't accept cursory explanations for things. If something is a certain way, there has got to be a reason. I feel knowing the reason informs the application thereafter. So when I decided to spend some time getting to know vim plugins, one of the first concepts the internets assumed I already knew was runtime.</p>

<h2>Core & Runtime</h2>

<p>I found some references to runtime, as in where to find it, but nothing to tell me its reason for existance. Turns out certain utilities/apps are comprised of two parts, core and runtime. The core is the main part and the runtime is everything else. So the relationship between the linux kernel and the gnu utilities is an analogy in the right direction. But runtime is a little bit more integrated. Plain vi is an example of the core, vim (which I believe is the only aspect I have ever used) includes a runtime. Vi doesn't have syntax highlighting or autoindent, just text editing.</p>

<h2>Runtime</h2>

<p>Many applications have a runtime. Eclipse has a runtime. Anything can have a runtime. Runtime just means the extensions, those components loaded 'at runtime' i.e. while it's running.</p>

<h2>Run Commands File</h2>

<p>So trying to relate this new information to what I already knew, by my logic bash has a runtime, since it has a .bashrc file. Turns out this isn't entirely correct. Files that include .rc in them are actually 'run command' files. <a href="http://kb.iu.edu/data/abnd.html">"The rc command derives from the runcom facility from the MIT CTSS system. 'There was a facility that would execute a bunch of commands stored in a file; it was called runcom for "run commands", and the file began to be called "a runcom". rc in Unix is a fossil from that usage.'"</a></p>


<h2>Runtime and Run Commands File</h2>

<p>A runtime component hangs out and actually continues to do work while the program is running, an .rc file executes its commands during the initialization of the application. The .rc file can be sourced again while the application is running but this usually requires the execution of a specific command. Runtime is constantly executing. For example vim's syntax plugin hangs out and colors text.</p>

<p>Most runtime components can be loaded and unloaded on the fly, for example vim only reads the Ruby syntax file when you open a .rb script. Like a Matrie d' figures out what you want and seats you (rc file), your waiter hangs out and helps you throughout the meal (runtime). Depending on what you want, you may be attended by the sommelier, various other stewards and a busperson. But they only show up if you want something that requires their assistance. So if you have over 500 syntax files for vim, you don't have to load any of them unless and until you need them.</p>

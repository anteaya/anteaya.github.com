    <p>I keep thinking I'm the only one. The only one who craves the opportunity to observe and learn and needs the space to do so. Turns out I'm wrong. I'm not the only one.</p>

    <p>Today might not be the best day to wax rhapsodic about my journey. Bit of a storm this morning. I tend to like to stay quiet during and after a storm to concentrate on repairs. However I have kept someone waiting too long for a reply to his enquiry. I was waiting for a good space to compose but it seems I must write while the hull is still creaking and the weather uncertain.</p>

    <p>I love learning. Being an apprentice gives me the permission to learn. I don't have to profess, I can be uncertain. I am allowed to spend more time observing when I am uncertain. Freedom to observe allows for better observations, which I feel leads to better conclusions. At least for me.</p>

    <p>I am extremely lucky. I have a mentor who values learning as much as I, perhaps more. We met in an online class I was taking. He was an incredibly detail oriented teaching assistant. I requested a chance to shoulder surf on some of his work. He agreed. I became his apprentice.</p>

    <p>Currently, he is creating small tasks for me. He is making me learn data structures. It is a far cry from the tutorials focused on syntax but at long last I am feeling that I am learning something that is useful. It is foundational information, the kind I have been seeking since I started really and didn't know it until I found it. It is useful to me since it transcends the language de jour. He has me writing the assignments in a couple of different languages. Since that is the perspective that I am driven to attain, I can see that this is useful for all languages.</p>

    <p>Finding a mentor who pays me to learn, from his own pocket, and will accept nothing less than my understanding of the data structure assignment before me is pretty special. I can't even put it on the spectrum of hard or easy. I just have to say that I'm so very grateful that I have the experience available to me, and I am glad that I am aware enough to recognize it for what it is. And to recognize my mentor for who he is. Someone who values learning and is willing to expend his own resources to ensure that it happens.</p>

    <p>He isn't alone. Just last night I had the good fortune to have a Skype call with someone who also treasures the apprenticeship experience. He is very selective of the apprentices he accepts and he works with them to ensure their success. He is committed to their success as a developer and also as a person. We had a lovely conversation.</p>

    <p>So they are out there. Mentors who know what it is to invest in an apprentice. It is a unique feeling to be in a learning relationship of apprenticeship. It is another person saying "You are valuable, and I will support your growth."</p>

    <p>To my fellow apprentices who are seeking what I seek, keep going. Mentors are out there. Hold true to your values. Do what gives your heart peace. Your heart will call the right mentor to you. Meet people, shake their hand, look in their eyes, listen to their voice and hear their words. Ask to work with them. Tell them you want to learn. Show them what you do and have done and include all fields not just development. They need to see your passion for creation. Who knows, one day you may be a mentor yourself.</p>
    
    <p>While composing this post, I was interrupted with a Skype call. Someone else I consider an incredibly powerful role model and mentor took a few minutes out of their busy day to spend with me and share their thoughts. That relationship just became stronger and now the sun is shining. I can feel a freshening breeze.</p>
    
    <p>Cheers.</p>

  <h1>Thoughts about Pizza</h1>
  <div class="sidenote">This post was motivated by two random tweets about pizza.</div>
  <p>I was working and scanning my Twitter feed tonight and saw a friend had just tweeted that he had been complimented by a homeless person for his adroit pizza-balancing while on a bicycle. He quoted the homeless person as saying, "I used to do that when I had a house."</p>
  <p>I was moved but uncertain how I felt and didn't reply. Another friend did with the comment, "That's so sad.", and it is. But beyond feeling sad what can I do? So after a moment, I went back to work.</p>
  <p>I follow a few celebs in my field, not because I figure any of them will converse with me, but sometimes they tweet worthy stuff. A recent addition tweeted tonight, about pizza of all things. He advised that folks who experience indicition about pizza topping choices should emulate him and order multiple pizzas.</p>
  <p>Now I feel and odd feeling in my stomach and I can't seem to resolve it.</p>
  <p>I've been thinking about this for a while and I still can file it neatly anywhere. Do I shrug? Do I berate celebs (why would I do that?)? Do I rally a call to action? For whom and to what purpose? "Pizza's for homeless" kinda falls flat and to be honest, I'm kinda called-to-action out right now, staying with the activites I already have.</p>
  <p>But I guess my point, if I have one, is that this isn't fitting in a tidy package for me. Can't get a perspective on this that allows me to name it and file it and get back to work. Like the unengaged students, this one just wants some attention but I'm uncertain what I can do.</p>
  <p>Like I said, I'm not even sure I have a point. Thanks for reading.</p>

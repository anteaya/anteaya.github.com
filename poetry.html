  <h1>Poetry by Anita Kuno</h1>
  <div class="sidenote">A place for me to post my poetry whenever the muse whispers in my ear.</div>
  <p>Darkness and light envelop my breath as I move forward, uncertain and hopeful. My feet, lost in darkness; my heart moves toward the glimmer.</p>
  <p>Confronting face of earth and rock. Fingers embedded in rootlets and moss. Tarsal arch lifts and cuts purchase. Shifting my weight, I ascend</p>
  <p>Home again. My dog greets me. Squinty eyes, she smells of sleep. Shakes with collar tags jingling. Puts her nose to the door and turns to me</p>
  <p>Sunshine creeping across my wall. Spreading out, increasing its claim. Sharp shadows from my furniture impede its dominance. Good morning.</p>
  <p>Crystal spires mark six points stamped from vapour high above. Stasis u-nique.. my-nique, his-nique, her-nique, their-nique. Flakes ya'snow.</p>
  <p>Water's slate gray resides in the sky, the air hangs heavy. Water & expectation. Lone flakes swirl partner-less descend and drop. Transition</p>
  <p>Virgin snow. I am first. Tyres impress the plough's windrow. Park; furry excitement bursts. Dog's paws mark our path & I follow branches low</p>
  <p>Wind tells testament of her travel. Bare treetops, maple branches dance, enact her passion; weighed branches freed. A wall of snow descends.</p>
  <p>Stars sparkle dance touch. Glide surface and shimmy. Smile, they beckon. Join and shine. Freely move and sing. I am enticed. My smile flies.</p>
  <p>Intently working; focused. My lap, it beckons. My cat valiantly responding to the call, leaps and settles. Cosy draped across my busy wrists</p>
  <p>my eyes open, draw breath extend my palms, inflate fan embers of my heart fill myself with gladness gratitude joy more and more full</p>
